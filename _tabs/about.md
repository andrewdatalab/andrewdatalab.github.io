> This blog is a restart. I used to write at [gooddatacenter.blogspot.com](https://gooddatacenter.blogspot.com/), about primarily in the area of Cisco networking, protocols, security, Citrix, VMware virtualization, and openstack but my last post was back in 2015. Life, work, and projects kept moving — the writing didn’t. I’m now resuming documentation on this new GitHub-based site to record what I build, learn, and think about — from cloud and networking to automation and AI. Writing helps me think clearly. This space is where those thoughts will live again.

> This blog is intended to archive my thoughts in the ever-evolving world of technology. I will talk about things that interest me and might be interesting to others,  endless command, shell script, clouds, automation and now AI world.
